    "# Module: SQLite3 Assignments\n",
    "## Lesson: SQLite3\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Creating and Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to create a new SQLite3 database named `test.db`.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to create a table named `employees` with columns `id` (integer), `name` (text), `age` (integer), and `department` (text) in the `test.db` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Inserting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to insert a new employee into the `employees` table.\n",
    "2. Insert at least 5 different employees into the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Querying Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to fetch and display all records from the `employees` table.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to fetch and display all employees from a specific department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Updating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to update the department of an employee based on their `id`.\n",
    "2. Update the department of at least 2 employees and display the updated records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Deleting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to delete an employee from the `employees` table based on their `id`.\n",
    "2. Delete at least 1 employee and display the remaining records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Advanced Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to fetch and display employees older than a certain age.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to fetch and display employees whose names start with a specific letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Handling Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to insert multiple employees into the `employees` table in a single transaction. Ensure that if any insertion fails, none of the insertions are committed.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to update the age of multiple employees in a single transaction. Ensure that if any update fails, none of the updates are committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Creating Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new table named `departments` with columns `id` (integer) and `name` (text).\n",
    "2. Modify the `employees` table to include a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `departments` table.\n",
    "3. Write a Python function to insert data into both the `departments` and `employees` tables, ensuring referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Indexing and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an index on the `name` column of the `employees` table.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to fetch and display all employees whose names start with a specific letter. Compare the performance with and without the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Backing Up and Restoring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function to back up the `test.db` database to a file named `backup.db`.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function to restore the `test.db` database from the `backup.db` file."
